# Interactive C++ code development using C++Explorer and GitHub Classroom for educational purposes

## Examples 

Note that you need need a [CxxExplorer](https://github.com/stevenrbrandt/CxxExplorer) running to execute the notebooks. However, you still can open the notebooks and
experience the C++Explorer features.

### Example for writing serial C++ code




### Example for HPX's parallel algorithms

After the inroduction of HPX in the lecture, the students learn that the need to use

```cpp
run_hpx([](){

//My code 

});
```
within a Cling cell to execute the HPX code in parallel. Please find the example [here](https://github.com/diehlpk/gateways2020/blob/master/hpx_parallel.ipynb). 

### Example for asyncronous programming


### Example to use pybind
